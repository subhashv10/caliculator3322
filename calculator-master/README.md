The goals for this project were simple:

Create a basic calculator that supports the following functionality:

+    Only basic math will be supported: +, -, *, /
+    Numbers can be positive or negative.
+    Decimal values will also be supported.

Improvements that could be made next include:

+    Add the % operator.
+    Support landscape orientation.
+    Support scientific calculator operations and beyond.
+    Add easter eggs when typing numbers that form words!

I'm new to iOS development, so I'm eager to get feedback any aspect of this project.
